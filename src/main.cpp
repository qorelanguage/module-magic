/** @mainpage %Qore Magic Module

\tableofcontents

This is a module for recognizing the type of data contained in a computer
file using so called magic numbers. It is a wrapper around <a href="http://darwinsys.com/file/">\c libmagic C
library</a> (covered by the standard Berkeley Software Distribution copyright).

This module is released under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html">LGPL 2.1</a>
and is tagged as such in the module's header (meaning it can be loaded unconditionally
regardless of how the %Qore library was initialized).

This module provides the following class:
- @ref Qore::Magic::Magic "Magic"

The <i>Single Unix Specification (SUS)</i> specifies that a series of tests are
performed on the file specified on the command line:
- if the file cannot be read, its status undetermined, or its type undetermined,
  @ref Qore::Magic::Magic "Magic" will indicate that the file was processed and its type was undetermined.
- file must be able to determine the types directory, FIFO, socket, block
  special file, and character special file
- zero-length files are identified as such
- an initial part of file is considered and @ref Qore::Magic::Magic "Magic" is to use position-sensitive tests
- the entire file is considered and @ref Qore::Magic::Magic "Magic" is to use context-sensitive tests
- the file is identified as a data file

@ref Qore::Magic::Magic "Magic" position-sensitive tests are normally implemented by matching various
locations within the file against a textual database of magic numbers.
This differs from other simpler methods such as file extensions and
schemes like MIME.

In most implementations, the file command uses a database to drive
the probing of the lead bytes. That database is implemented in
file called \c magic, whose location is usually in \c /etc/magic,
\c /usr/share/file/magic or a similar location.

To use the module in a %Qore script, use the \c %%requires directive as in the following example:
@code{.py}
%new-style
%strict-args
%require-types
%enable-all-warnings

# import the magic module API
%requires magic

Magic m(MAGIC_MIME_TYPE);
printf("%y\n", m.file("/etc/resolv.conf"));
@endcode
The above command would result in the following output when executed on a standard UNIX or UNIX-like system:
@verbatim
"inode/symlink; charset=binary"
@endverbatim

    @subsection magic_1_0_0 magic Module Version 1.0.0
    - initial release
